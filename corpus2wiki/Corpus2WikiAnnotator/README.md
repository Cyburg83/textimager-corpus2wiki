# Corpus2Wiki Annotator

Corpus2WikiAnnotator is a MediaWiki extension that can be used to Annotate Words, Sentences, Paragraphs and Texts with key-value pairs. It provides the following features:

- Tool-tips with information about Words, Sentences and Paragraphs in tabular form
- Info-box with information about the text
- Function to mark Words based on their annotations

The Extension is based on the Mediawiki Extension [Simple Tooltip](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SimpleTooltip).


## Registered Hooks

The following hooks are registered by the extension and can be used with the shown syntax:

- `{{#word: MyWord | attribute1:value1,attribute2:value2,...}}`
- `{{#sentence: Nr | START}}`
- `{{#sentence: Nr | END | attribute1:value1,attribute2:value2,...}}`
- `{{#paragraph: Id | START | attribute1:value1,attribute2:value2,...}}`
- `{{#paragraph: Id | END }}`
- `{{#paragraph: Id | END }}`
- `{{#textinfo: attribute1:value1,attribute2:value2,...}}`

## Generated HTML
The tags/hooks and their comprised information are converted to HTML for display.

The generated HTML is for all information kinds (except text information) a <span>-Object which encloses the text displayed and also contains the table which is displayed in the tool-tip.

The textinfo is just converted to a HTML table, that is displayed on the right side of the MediaWiki page.

The paragraph and sentence hooks open, respectively, close a separate <span>-object, which have a distinct class name. This is done to keep the hierarchical structure, and thereby enclosing all the elements that belong to the sentence/paragraph.
