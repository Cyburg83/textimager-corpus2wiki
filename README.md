## File information
dumper.sh: 	runs the CLI jar
 
importer.sh:	
-copies the output (XML) file into the maintenance file in container
-copies the SimpleTooltip, Graph and JSon extension into extensions file in container
-runs importDump.php and rebuilds mediawiki
-adds the line "require_once "$IP/extensions/SimpleTooltip-master/SimpleTooltip.php" (and all other extension configs)	to the LocalSettings.php file (runs the extensions)

dumpCreator.java: creates processes for both scripts and runs them.
