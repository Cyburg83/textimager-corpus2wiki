# textimager-wikidition

DEPENDENCIES: textimager-client (should this also be included in docker image?)

1. Create a directory for your project.
2. Download mediawiki image, stack.yml file, java files & scripts to this directory and run using docker-compose -f stack.yml up
3. Open your browser and go to localhost:8080
4. Follow the mediawiki wizard for set up: for language, admin account etc., enter your own preferences, and for the database entries, please use the following entries:
- Database type: MySQL
- Database host: database
- Database name: wikidb
- Database table prefix: LEAVE BLANK
- Database username: root
- Database password: wikiexporterpw
- Check the box for "use the same a/c as for installation"
- Storage Engine: InnoDB
- Name of wiki and following settings: your choice
5. Once the set up is complete, a file called LocalSettings.php will be downloaded. Save this file to your working directory.
6. Now go into the stack.yml file, uncomment the LocalSettings.php line, and re run it. (using command from above)
7. Now go to localhost:8080 again and you should have a mediawiki all set up and ready to go!

To run wikiexporter:

Run java dumpCreator - and that's it! 

visit localhost:8080, visit "localhost/index.php/Corpus" and you should see a list of links to your files - click on any one of them and your text (with grammatical infos as tool tips) will be visible.

dumper.sh: 	runs the CLI jar
 
importer.sh:	
-copies the output (XML) file into the maintenance file in container
-copies the SimpleTooltip, Graph and JSon extension into extensions file in container
-runs importDump.php and rebuilds mediawiki
-adds the line "require_once "$IP/extensions/SimpleTooltip-master/SimpleTooltip.php" (and all other extension configs)	to the LocalSettings.php file (runs the extensions)

dumpCreator.java: creates processes for both scripts and runs them.
