Wikidition is based on MediaWiki and allows the vizualisation of word-, sentence-, paragraph- and text-information. It provides tooltips for all the information, supports graphical hilighting of word-based information, shows a histogram of POS-frequency and a map of the locations mentioned in the text.

The text analysis is made by the TextImager service provided by the Text Technology Lab (University of Frankfurt). Wikidition currently supports POS, MORPH, DDC, Lemma and NE information in German and English texts.

An import form is provided for simple and automated document analysis and import.
