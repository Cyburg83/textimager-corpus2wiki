# textimager-wikidition

## Installation:

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Download this repo
3. Runn installation, configuration and start containers using docker-compose -f stack.yml up (if you want a newly compiled wikidition container, add --build)
3. Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 

Mediawiki is now set up with the following parameters:

```
- MW_ADMIN_USER=admin
- MW_ADMIN_PASS=password
- MW_DB_NAME=wikidb
- MW_DB_USER=mediawiki
- MW_DB_PASS=wikidbpw
- MW_DB_INSTALLDB_USER=root
- MW_DB_INSTALLDB_PASS=wikiexporterpw
```

## Add Files to Wikitition:

1. Make sure the containers are running, then open your browser and go to localhost:8080/import
2. Select all the files you want to be analized and added to the Wikidition
3. Pressing the "Import"-Button will start the import procedure. Please keep the browser open until the process is finished.

(Please note that currently the above process is not fully implemented yet. As of now, files need to be copied using `docker cp MY_LOCAL_FOLDER wikidition:/var/www/html/import/corpus`and then the import procedure can be started by going to localhost8080:import/importer.php?lang=en)

## Access Results
visit localhost:8080 (or the adress that is indicated in the terminal during service startup - This needs to be fixed), visit "localhost/index.php/Special:AllPages" and you should see a list of links to your files - click on any one of them and your text (with grammatical infos as tool tips) will be visible.
